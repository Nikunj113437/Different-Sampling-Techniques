# Different-Sampling-Techniques
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, or observations from a larger population. The goal of sampling is to obtain a representative subset of the population that can be used to estimate population characteristics with a reasonable level of accuracy.

There are several different sampling techniques that can be used, including:

Simple random sampling: In this technique, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

Stratified sampling: This involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on some relevant characteristic, and then selecting a random sample from each stratum in proportion to the size of the stratum.

Cluster sampling: In this technique, the population is divided into clusters (e.g., geographic regions or schools) and a random sample of clusters is selected. Data is then collected from all individuals within the selected clusters.

Systematic sampling: This involves selecting every nth member of the population after randomly selecting a starting point.
